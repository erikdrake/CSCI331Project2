TODO:

fix error:

  ..\main.cpp|53|undefined reference to `ReplacementSelectionSort<std::string>::sort(std::vector<std::string, std::allocator<std::string> >, int, bool)'|
  
Once the program compiles and it makes the sorted list, we need to add debugging info to recieve aditional information...

an identification of which file the (input) unsorted records are from,
an identification of which file the (output) sorted records are placed in,
the number of records that can fit in memory,
the number of records,
the number of runs,
the smallest, largest and arithmetic mean number or records in all of the runs,
